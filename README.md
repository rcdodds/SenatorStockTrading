This project currently uses Python Selenium to scrape that website and store the data in a SQLite database.

The data contained at the transactional level is surprisingly vague. The amount of each transaction is a range (e.g. $1,001 - $15,000 or $50,001 - $100,000). There is no record of the price that the security was bought/sold for or the time of day that the transaction occured.


#### Terms & Conditions
By accessing the data contained in these reports you inherently agree to the following terms and conditions

Title 1 of the Ethics in Government Act of 1978, as amended, 5 U.S.C. app. ยง 105(c), states that:

It shall be unlawful for any person to obtain or use a report:
for any unlawful purpose;
for any commercial purpose, other than by news and communications media for dissemination to the general public;
for determining or establishing the credit rating of any individual; or
for use, directly or indirectly, in the solicitation of money for any political, charitable, or other purpose.

The Attorney General may bring a civil action against any person who obtains or uses a report for any purpose prohibited in paragraph (1) of this subsection. The court in which such action is brought may assess against such person a penalty in any amount not to exceed $10,000. Such remedy shall be in addition to any other remedy available under statutory or common law.

I understand the prohibitions on obtaining and use of financial disclosure reports.
